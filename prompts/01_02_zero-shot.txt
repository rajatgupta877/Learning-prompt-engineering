Here, we are just giving context and asking question afterwards. There is no answer pattern we want to follow.

Comment: This pizza is probably the best in town. If you’re looking for thin-crusted goodness, you now know where to go. Five stars. 
Comment: I loved the pizza, but the overall dining experience was not great. The floor was dirty and the bathroom didn’t have a change table so I had to change our baby on top of the toilet which is not ideal. 
Comment: Why do restaurants never get my order right? I specifically said I wanted the Supreme Vegetarian and to add pepperoni on top. When I arrived to pick up my order, the person at the counter said they had forgotten to add the pepperoni and asked if I could take the pizza anyway. They didn’t even offer a refund. I said I wanted what I ordered and they went back and made a new pizza. No apology, and I had to wait 20 minutes longer than necessary. Not great.
Question: Is this a good restaurant to bring a large family with two babies and people with various dietary restrictions?
